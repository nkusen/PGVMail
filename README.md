# PGVMail
This is an automatic web application I made to scrape information from the official website of my high school (http://www.gimnazija-varazdin.skole.hr/) and send notifications
to all users if a new message has been added to the website. Users can subscribe to this service and every time there is a new message they recieve an email containing the
original HTML code of the message (along wiht some changes to maintain hypertext functionality) and a link to the message on high school website. I made this application as to
know of any new messages posted on the website immediately and I believe that it can be useful to other students and easily changed to scrape messages from other schools' 
websites.
